	abstract = {Cellular tissue behavior is a multiscale problem. At the cell level, out of equilibrium, biochemical reactions drive physical cell–cell interactions in a typical active matter process. Cell modeling computer simulations are a robust tool to explore countless possibilities and test hypotheses. Here, we introduce a two-dimensional, extended active matter model for biological cells. A ring of interconnected self-propelled particles represents the cell. Neighboring particles are subject to harmonic and bending potentials. Within a characteristic time, each particle's self-velocity tends to align with its scattering velocity after an interaction. Translational modes, rotational modes, and mixtures of these appear as collective states. Using analytical results derived from active Brownian particles, we identify effective characteristic time scales for ballistic and diffusive movements. Finite-size scale investigation shows that the ring diffusion increases linearly with its size when in collective movement. A study on the ring shape reveals that all collective states are present even when bending forces are weak. In that case, when in a translational mode, the collective velocity aligns with the largest ring's direction in a spontaneous polarization emergence.},

In our model particles are driven with a constant absolute velocity and at each time step assume the average direction of motion of the particles in their neighborhood with some random perturbation (\${\textbackslash}eta\$) added. We present numerical evidence that this model results in a kinetic phase transition from no transport (zero average velocity, \${\textbar} \{{\textbackslash}bf v\}\_a {\textbar} =0\$) to finite net transport through spontaneous symmetry breaking of the rotational symmetry. The transition is continuous since \${\textbar} \{{\textbackslash}bf v\}\_a {\textbar}\$ is found to scale as \$({\textbackslash}eta\_c-{\textbackslash}eta){\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}beta\$ with \${\textbackslash}beta{\textbackslash}simeq 0.45\$.},

Even though the particles interact strictly locally in a very noisy manner, we show that cohesion can be maintained, even in the zero-density limit of an arbitrarily large flock in an infinite space. The phase diagram spanned by the two main parameters of our model, which encode the tendencies for particles to align and to stay together, contains non-moving “gas”, “liquid” and “solid” phases separated from their moving counterparts by the onset of collective motion. The “gas/liquid” and “liquid/solid” are shown to be first-order phase transitions in all cases. In the cohesive phases, we study also the diffusive properties of individuals and their relation to the macroscopic motion and to the shape of the flock.},

Near the critical density a complex picture emerges with interacting clusters of cells moving in groups. Motivated by these experiments we have constructed a flocking model that exhibits a continuous transition to the ordered phase, while assuming only short-range interactions and no explicit information about the knowledge of the directions of motion of neighbors. Placing cells in microfabricated arenas we found spectacular whirling behavior which we could also reproduce in simulations.},

              Collectively coordinated cell migration plays a role in tissue embryogenesis, cancer, homeostasis and healing. To study these processes, different cell-based modelling approaches have been developed, ranging from lattice-based cellular automata to lattice-free models that treat cells as point-like particles or extended detailed cell shape contours. In the spirit of what Osborne

              , 1–34] did for cellular tissue structure simulation models, we here compare five simulation models of collective cell migration, chosen to be representatives in increasing order of included detail. They are Vicsek–Grégoire particles, Szabó-like particles, self-propelled Voronoi model, cellular Potts model, and multiparticle cells, where each model includes cell motility. We examine how these models compare when applied to the same biological problem, and what differences in behaviour are due to different model assumptions and abstractions. For this purpose, we use a benchmark that discriminates between complex material flow models, and that can be experimentally approached using cell cultures: the flow within a channel around a circular obstacle, that is, the geometry Stokes used in his historical 1851 experiment. For each model we explain how to best implement it; vary cell density, attraction force and alignment interaction; draw the resulting maps of velocity, density and deformation fields; and eventually discuss its respective advantages and limitations. We thus provide a recommendation on how to select a model to answer a given question, and we examine whether models of motile particles and motile cells display similar collective effects.},

	abstract = {Cell cortex contraction is essential for shaping cells, enabling movement, ensuring proper division, maintaining tissue integrity, guiding development, and responding to mechanical signals - all critical for the life and health of multicellular organisms. Differential contractions in cell membranes, particularly when cells of different types interact, play a crucial role in the emergence of segregation. In this study, we introduce a model where rings composed of active particles interact through differential membrane contraction within a specified cutoff distance. We demonstrate that segregation arises solely from differential contraction, with the activity of the rings functioning similarly to an effective temperature. Additionally, we observed that segregation involves cluster fusion-diffusion process. However, the decay exponent of the segregation parameter we found is close to \${\textbackslash}lambda {\textbackslash}sim -1/3\$, which differs from the \${\textbackslash}lambda {\textbackslash}sim -1/4\$ predicted by previous theoretical approaches and simulations.},

Then we examine how to accelerate this algorithm and how to handle special cases. Furthermore we compare these algorithms with those found in literature and discuss the results.},
